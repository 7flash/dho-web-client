    <div class="text-h6">Welcome to the Hypha DAO!</div>
    <div class="text-subtitle2">Hypha is a global, open organization that's launching SEEDS and other decentralized applications.</div>
    <div>Our mission is to create the tools to help our Regenerative Society to flourish.
<br/>
SEEDS wouldn't be decentralized if the team behind it was centralized. For this reason and many more we've opened up the organization for all to participate and direct.
<br/>
Hypha DAO is an experiment in the future of organizations. Not only are you participating in co-creating SEEDS but you're also participating in co-creating Hypha. You can have a direct impact in how this organization evolves.
<br/>
Here's how to get started:
<br/>
1. Download SQRL (https://telosfoundation.io/downloads) (this is your wallet that will store your Hypha and Seeds tokens).
<br/>
2. Goto acorns.fun tutorial 1&2 to create your Telos account. (We encourage finishing the tutorial but you only need to do the first 2 lessons. Approximately 20 minutes.)
<br/>
Note: The tutorial will encourage you to make an account name that has to do with a squirre. You don't have to do that.
<br/>
3. Send your brand new account name to the telegram group (https://t.me/seedscommunity) for membership approval.
<br/>
4. While you’re waiting for approval you can visit the roles tab to see what roles are currently available. Roles that are less than 100% filled are open.
<br/>
5. Once approved. If you find a role that excites you feel free to apply for that role. When applying for a role chose what percentage (100% being full time at 40 hours a week) of that role you’re applying for.
<br/>
If there isn’t a role for you and you want to contribute to Hypha, feel free to propose a new role. First, join the telegram group to discuss the creation of a new role to help design it. Otherwise, it may not be accepted.
<br/>
6. If you have a proposal for a past or future one-time contribution. Propose it in the contributions tab.
<br/>
7. Start creating! Make sure to check back each new moon and full moon to collect your salary and vote on new proposals, roles, launch partners and assignments.
<br/>
8. Welcome to the future
